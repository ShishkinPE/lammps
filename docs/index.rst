Welcome to pyLIon's documentation!
==================================

.. _LAMMPS: http://lammps.sandia.gov/

pylion is a python3 wrapper for the popular molecular dynamics package LAMMPS_.
LAMMPS_ is a classical molecular dynamics code, the current version of which has been in active development since 2004.
The project's longevity and highly active use (the original 1995 paper was cited 1,127 times in 2013) has resulted in an optimised and feature-rich program.

pylion attempts to provide the ion trap community access to the features of LAMMPS_ via a more simplistic syntax and usage of familiar terms.
