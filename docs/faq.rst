**Q: pylion is great. How can I send you all my money?**

No need for that really.
If you find pylion useful please consider citing it in your publication.

**Q: How can I change the lammps executable?**

The full path to the executable must be defined in the ``executable`` attribute of a ``Simulation``.
You should define the full path since ``pylion`` will not check for any bash aliases.
